These are the source files for my Master's thesis, Designing A New Programming Environment for Randomized Controlled Trials

Run the run.sh to start the parser.

Kieler WorkSpace has some Kieler models.

The WebService folder contains the server and client sides. Run the server and connect the SQL DB first. Register some users and then use the client side to log in as users.

The Usage/CPU Test folder contains the data I used in the thesis.

Some jar files required are also attached.
